          <p>
            Your donation will help us act quickly during the early hours and
            days to save lives and provide safe spaces, water, food, shelter and
            support to children and their families, when and where they need it
            most.

            <h1>Food for a family</h1>
            <p>
              During a disaster, nonperishable food is always in demand. The
              most essential products are canned meats, fruits, soups, stews and
              veggies; peanut butter and jelly; cereal and breakfast bars;
              bottled water and juices and personal hygiene products.

            <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
            <p>
              You can provide tents and other essential shelters for families
              that have lost everything in the event of a catastrophe. Every
              penny we raise together might give a family a home, and with a
              home comes a strong sense of new hope.

            <p>
              Children are in a position to continue their education after
              becoming confident and independent learners. Help improve the
              prospects for a bright future for tribal children by giving them
              the opportunity to pursue their education.

          <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
          <p>
            You could think of charity as something you do with the extra change
            you find lying around, or backing a friend running in a local race.
            This is what we used to feel until we learned what even a small
            amount of money can do when it is given to the right organizations.
